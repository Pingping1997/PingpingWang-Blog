Hey, I’m Pingping Wang, currently pursuing a PhD at TU Wien (Vienna), where I work at the intersection of sustainability and process systems engineering. My research focuses on integrating carbon capture and storage/utilization (CCS/CCU) into current and future industrial infrastructures. I’m developing a prospective life cycle optimization framework to evaluate and support the deployment of CCS/CCU and carbon dioxide removal (CDR) technologies—aiming to mitigate CO₂ emissions from both heavy industry and the atmosphere.

Beyond engineering, I’m deeply curious about the evolution of socio-economic systems and human behavior, especially in relation to fairness in decarbonization and sustainable development.

I’m a committed supporter of open-source efforts in systems engineering, energy transition, and social & climate justice—and I’m always learning how to better contribute to these communities.

When I’m not in front of a screen, you’ll probably find me outdoors: climbing, playing tennis, cycling, swimming, reading/thinking, or enjoying food and music.

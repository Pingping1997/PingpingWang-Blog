Hey, I am Pingping, Wang. Now, I am a PhD student at TU Wien, working in field of sustainability and process systems engineering. My research work is focusing on the integration of carbon capture and storage/utilization (CCS/CCU) into current and future industrial infrastructures. 

I am curious about the evolution and comparisons of different social-economic systems and human behaviour. It can help me better understand the fairness in decarbonization and sustainable development. Furthermore, I am also interested in quantitatively project the scenarios of future. 

I grew up in a chemical industry city known as the "Oil City". My personal growth story also resolves around the chemical industry and chemical engineering. The chemical pollution and interest in chemistry that I have been exposed to since childhood have made me interested in this field since middle school. At that time, I believed that I could change the world through chemistry but create a world without so much pollution.

I studied BSc, chemical engineering at Southwest Petroleum University in Chengdu. I had a very fulfilling four years, participating in and leading different student teams to win awards in many national and international extracurricular competitions. After participating in a Belt and Road Challenge Cup in Shanghai, I had the idea of studying abroad. Then, I got opportunties to study my double master program in Sino-Danish Center of University of Chinese Academy of Science in Beijing. I completed a full-English speaking master program from Technical University of Denmark (DTU).
